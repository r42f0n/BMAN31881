ESSAY TOPIC I 
Mega Firms A major topic in recent economic literature is the emergence of   mega firms - companies   that   operate   in   multiple   markets,   have   large   market   shares   around   the   world,   wield   enormous   market   power,   and   invest   heavily   in   RD,   new   technologies,   brands,   and   marketing. In this assignment, you are tasked with writing an essay to:
1.       Explore the academic economic literature to characterise mega firms and document   key stylized facts   about mega   firms.
2.       Develop   a   conceptual   framework   (theory)   to   explain   the   rise   of mega   firms.   The   framework should:
a)       Explain   why   a   firm's   quality   at   birth   (in   its   early   years)   can   shape   its   future   performance and affect its chance of   achieving   star   status.
b)      Discuss   how   static   and   dynamic   scale   economies   due   to   technology,   global   competition, network effects and RD costs can   amplify   the   effects   of   a   firm's initial success and growth and thereby enable the firm代 写BMAN31881 ESSAY IN ECONOMIC ANALYSIS II ESSAY TOPIC I Mega Firms

c)       Explain   the   role   of   various   winner-take-most   mechanisms   that   are   responsible for the rise of   mega firms and highlight the interplay between demand-side (e.g.   brands) and supply-side (e.g., RD) factors in   driving these   mechanisms.
3.       Examine the impact   of   mega-firms   on   small   and medium   firms. How   may   the   rise   of   mega-firms affect the chances of   new firms and small firms to grow and survive?   How may small firms scale up and compete   with   dominant   firms?You   must   draw   on   relevant   economic   concepts   and   theories   to   provide   a   systematic   analysis. Failure   to   use   relevant   theories can lead   to a   low   mark. It is important   to inform   your analysis by referring to relevant data and support it using peer-reviewed economic   journals.Several   notes   and papers   will be placed   on   the   course webpage   to   guide   you   through   your research   and help you with the   emerging literature   on   mega   firms.   One   note   will   specify the marking guidelines in detail. Follow the guidelines to carefully organise the   assignment.
